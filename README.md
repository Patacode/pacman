# The Pacman game

This project is replica of the classic __Pacman__ game written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript only.

The application follow the _MVC_ design pattern which separates the projet into 3 parts:
* model (for the game components and logic)
* view (for the user interaction and the element display and positioning)
* controller (to control the model and view)

## How does it works ?

To run the web quiz application, simply open the `index.html` file (found under the root directory of the project) with
the web browser of your choice, such in (using firefox):

```
firefox index.html
```
